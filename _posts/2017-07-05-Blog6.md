    <td>I learned well when I could easily follow the instructions that were shown and when the Instructions are clear and definite I know that I can do the exercise. Reading the instructions and analysing them helps a lot to complete each stage of the code. That is what I found useful this lesson.

  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on when questions are more open and do not have a definite rule. I need to recall what I have learned previously and be able to include that in my code without needing too much help. This would make me a lot better at the codecademy course and would help my progress through the steps.</td>

    <td>I will improve my learning by making sure that I become more independent, focused, and logical in my thought processes. This will make me better at the Python project and I will greatly benefit from this.
