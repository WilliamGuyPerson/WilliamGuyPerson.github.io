In this lesson we thought about what level of detail and information computers need  to do simple tasks. For example to "fill the kettle" takes a great deal more instructions for a robot arm, to move every joint and turn to the right place. If you do not think of every basic step the program will fail. This lesson was very interesting and insightful into the way computers process information.
